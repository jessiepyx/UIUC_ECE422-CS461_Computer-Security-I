# Final Decision

We think the primary suspect murdered the victim, base on the following reasons:

- The primary suspect knew from Peter about about the bribery, so he/she planned the whistle-blower complaint letter on the victim's computer in order to frame the second suspect.
- The complaint letter left open in the crime scene was probably planned by the primary suspect too.
- According to the communication between Peter and the primary suspect, the victim knew about the illigal arms dealing that the primary suspect was involved with, which is a motivation for the murder.
- The escape location is in UIUC, which is close to the crime scene.
