# Attack

**Perform dead analysis on the victim's disk:**

- Enter directory ***var/log/***
- Inspect ***lastlog*** to find the attacker IPs: 10.46.1.105 and 10.46.1.106
- Run command ***sudo cat auth.log | grep -Ea "\b10.46.1.10[56]\b"*** to see all authentication actions related to the attacker, and to find the first attack time.
- Run command ***sudo cat syslog | grep -Ea "\b([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"*** to find all strings that look like IPv4 addresses
- Locate the logs slightly before the first attack, and from those containing "DHCP" find out the IPv4 address assigned to the victim.
